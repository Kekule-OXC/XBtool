                ***** LBA48 Warning *****

For those moving from a non-LBA48 BIOS, if your drive is
greater than 137GB and you already have a partition 6
which goes up to the 137GB barrier then choosing the
partitioning option "Partition 6 Takes Rest of the Drive"
will result in data corruption when the drive is written
to. You'll need to reformat the drive if you want to
resize your partition 6 to use all available space.
